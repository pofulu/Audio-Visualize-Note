== SimpleSpectrum Changelog ==


-V2.0-
	NOTE: Because of the various changes in this update, your existing SimpleSpectrums and OutputVolumes might need checking for unintended effects of new properties.
	
	- OutputVolume Overhaul:
		- Multiple output types can now be chosen from: BarPrefab (same as before), ObjectPosition, ObjectRotation and ObjectScaling.
		  The new 'Object' outputs can move, rotate or scale their gameObject, allowing for VU (needly) meters and bouncy things!
		- New custom Inspector view

	- Source Types:
		- Both SimpleSpectrum and OutputVolume have been given their enumerators called SourceType, which control the source of input data.
		- Both have the values AudioSource, AudioListener (both the same as before) and Custom, which allows you to input your own data using new exposed properties.
		- SimpleSpectrum also has Microphone and StereoMix in its Source Types.
		
	- Microphone Sources:
		SimpleSpectrum can now automatically start Microphone recordings and hook them up to the Spectrum!
		The Microphone SourceType uses the computer's default microphone and the StereoMix SourceType uses the computer's Stereo Mix (output) device.
		Due to some strange issues with this class, the recording is occasionally restarted to keep it fresh.
		This is done in the RestartMicrophone function, if you ever need to do this yourself (i.e. after default microphone changes).
	
	- Shaded Bars:
	  Three extra bar types that use a Surface shader, meaning bars can now be shaded, cast & recieve shadows!
	  
	- UI/Image Bars:
	  Three extra Bar Prefabs that use the UI.Image class and added support in SimpleSpectrum and OutputVolume.	
	
	- Support for textures in the LightweightGradientLerpSprite shader, allowing custom textured Sprite or UI bars.
	
	- More presets which utilise the new features.
	
	- New Demo scenes showcasing the AudioMixerGroup Mute 'feature', file opening, Microphone input and others.
	
	- All customisable properties of SimpleSpectrum and OutputVolume now have tooltips.
	
	- Added custom Component icons for SimpleSpectrum and OutputVolume

	- If the bendAngle in SimpleSpectrum is 360 degrees, the script now recenters the bars around the pivot, so scaling works correctly.
	
	- Gotten rid of the () from SimpleSpectrum in branding. It was silly.
	
	- Various bug fixes & optimisations.

-v1.1-
	- The Spectrum class has been renamed to SimpleSpectrum.

	- New properties colorAttackDamp and colorDecayDamp have been added to SimpleSpectrum and OutputVolume.
	  These allow for smoother changes of bar colour.

	- A 'channel' property has been added to OutputVolume and 'channelUsed' to OutputVolume.GetRMS to specify audio channel of output volume.

	- SimpleSpectrum.isEnabled has been made visible in the custom inspector view.

	- More presets have been added and can be found in Assets/SimpleSpectrum/Presets.

	- Various bug fixes & optimisations.
