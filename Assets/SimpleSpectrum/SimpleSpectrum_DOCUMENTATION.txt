--QUICK SETUP--

1) Create an empty GameObject.

2) Add the SimpleSpectrum component.

3) Specify the AudioSource to use by draging the AudioSource object onto the Audio Source property in the Inspector.

Done!

...or just use one of the preset Spectrums :)

--CLASSES / COMPONENTS--

SimpleSpectrum:
	This Component handles AudioSource (or AudioListener) spectrum data and creates visual specturms.
	Using an instance of this class will automatically create a spectrum using the specified prefab.
	However, it also contains a static method to generate a logarithmically scaled float array of spectrum data for you to use how you wish.

	Required properties for functionality: barPrefab.
	
	Properties:
	
		bool isEnabled: Enables or disables the processing and display of spectrum data. 
		
		-SAMPLING-

		SourceType sourceType:			The type of source of spectrum data. Can be AudioSource, AudioListener, Microphone, StereoMix or Custom.
		
		AudioSource audioSource:		The AudioSource to take data from. Can be null if sourceType is not AudioSource.
				
		int sampleChannel:				The audio channel to use when sampling.

		int numSamples:					The number of samples to use when sampling. Must be a power of two.
		
		FFTWindow windowUsed: 			The FFTWindow to use when sampling.
		
		bool useLogarithmicFrequency:	If true, audio data is scaled logarithmically.		
		
		bool multiplyByFrequency:		If true, the values of the spectrum are multiplied based on their frequency, to keep the values proportionate.
		
		float highFrequencyTrim:		Determines what percentage of the full frequency range to use.
										(1 being the full range, reducing the value towards 0 cuts off high frequencies)
										This can be useful when using MP3 files or audio with missing high frequencies.

		float linearSampleStretch:		When useLogarithmicFrequency is false, this value stretches the spectrum data onto the bars.
		
		-BARS-
		
		int barAmount: 					The amount of bars to use.
		
		float barYScale:				Stretches the values of the bars.
		
		float barMinYScale:				Sets a minimum scale for the bars; they will never go below this scale.
										This value is also used when isEnabled is false.
		
		GameObject barPrefab:			The prefab of bar to use when building.
										See below for how to use custom prefabs.
		
		float barXScale:				Stretches the bars sideways. 
		
		float barXSpacing:				Increases the spacing between bars.
		
		float barCurveAngle:			Bends the Spectrum using a given angle.
		
		float barXRotation:				Rotates the Spectrum inwards or outwards.
										Especially useful when using barCurveAngle.
		
		float attackDamp:				The amount of dampening used when the new scale is higher than the bar's existing scale.
										Must be between 0 (slowest) and 1 (fastest).
		
		float decayDamp:				The amount of dampening used when the new scale is lower than the bar's existing scale.
										Must be between 0 (slowest) and 1 (fastest).
		
		-COLOR-
		
		bool useColorGradient:			Determines whether to apply a color gradient on the bars, or just use colorMin as a solid color.
		
		Color colorMin:					The minimum (low value) color if useColorGradient is true, else the solid color to use.
		
		Color colorMax:					The maximum (high value) color if useColorGradient is true.
		
		AnimationCurve colorValueCurve:	The curve that determines the interpolation between colorMin and colorMax.

		float colorAttackDamp:			The amount of dampening used when the new color value is higher than the existing color value.
										Must be between 0 (slowest) and 1 (fastest).	

		float colorDecayDamp:			The amount of dampening used when the new color value is lower than the existing color value.
										Must be between 0 (slowest) and 1 (fastest).
		
	Methods:
	
		public void RebuildSpectrum:
			Destroys the existing spectrum and rebuilds this instance. Can be called in Play mode to apply programmatic changes.
			
		public static float[] GetLogarithmicSpectrumData:
			Returns a logarithmically scaled and proportionate array of spectrum data from the AudioSource.
			
			Parameters:
				AudioSource source:		The AudioSource to take data from.
				
				int spectrumSize:		The size of the returned array.
				
				int sampleSize:			The size of sample to take from the AudioSource. Must be a power of two.
				
				FFTWindow windowUsed:	The FFTWindow to use when taking audio samples. Default: FFTWindow.BlackmanHarris
				
				int channelUsed:		The channel to take audio from. Default: 0 (Left)
	
	
	Note: While in the editor, editing some features (i.e. curving, scaling) can be visualised in real-time. For performance reasons, this feature is disabled in builds.
	If you wish to enable this feature in builds, remove the '#if UNITY_EDITOR' conditions SimpleSpectrum.Update().
	
	
OutputVolume:
	This Component handles AudioSource output data and creates a visual volume meter.
	Using an instance of this class will automatically create a volume meter using the specified prefab.
	However, it also contains a static method to return the current volume of an AudioSource that you can use how you wish.
		
	Properties:
	
		bool isEnabled: Enables or disables the processing and display of volume data. 
		
		-SAMPLING-

		SourceType sourceType:		The type of source of volume data. Can be AudioSource, AudioListener or Custom.
		
		AudioSource audioSource:	The AudioSource to take data from.
		
		int sampleAmount:			The number of samples to use when sampling. Must be a power of two.
		
		int channel:				The audio channel to take data from.

		float attackDamp:			The amount of dampening used when the new scale is higher than the bar's existing scale.
									Must be between 0 (slowest) and 1 (fastest).

									See below for how to use custom prefabs.
		
		
		bool scalePrefab: 			Determines whether to scale the bar prefab (i.e. disable for just colouring).
		
		bool useColorGradient: 		Determines whether to apply a color gradient on the bar.
		
		Color minColor:				The minimum (low value) color.
		
		Color maxColor:				The maximum (high value) color.
		
		AnimationCurve colorCurve:	The curve that determines the interpolation between colorMin and colorMax.

		float colorAttackDamp:		The amount of dampening used when the new color value is higher than the existing color value.
									Must be between 0 (slowest) and 1 (fastest).	

		float colorDecayDamp:		The amount of dampening used when the new color value is lower than the existing color value.
									Must be between 0 (slowest) and 1 (fastest).
	
	Methods:
	
		public static float GetRMS:
			Returns the current output volume of the AudioSource, using the RMS method.
			
			Parameters:
				AudioSource aSource:	The AudioSource to reference.

				int sampleSize:			The number of samples to take, as a power of two.
										Higher values mean more precise volume.

				int channelUsed:		The channel to take data from. Default: 0 (Left)

			Note: The RMS of audio data is an average of the sound amplitude.
			While it may be assumed that the maximum output value is 0.5 (equivalent to 0dB), lounder sounds will exceed this value. 
			You may wish to clamp the output value of GetRMS between 0 and 0.5.
			
		public static float GetRMS:
			The same as GetRMS above, but uses the AudioListener.
			
			Parameters:
				int sampleSize:			The number of samples to take, as a power of two.
										Higher values mean more precise volume.

				int channelUsed:		The channel to take data from. Default: 0 (Left)



--PREFABS--

SimpleSpectrum comes with numerous prefabs to quickly get started.

SpectrumOrigin:	A premade instance of the Spectrum Component.

OutputVolume:	A premade instance of the OutputVolume Component.

Bar Prefabs:
	Any of these prefabs can be used as the barPrefab of Spectrum or prefab of OutputVolume.
	
	Bottom:			Scales from the bottom of the bar (upwards).
	
	Middle:			Scales from the middle of the bar (both directions).
	
	Lower:			Scales from the lower region of the bar (80% upwards, 20% downwards).
	
	SpriteBottom:	Sprite equivalent of Bottom.
	
	SpriteMiddle:	Sprite equivalent of Middle.
	
	SpriteLower:	Sprite equivalent of Lower.
	
	UIBottom:		UI.Image equivalent of Bottom.
	
	UIMiddle:		UI.Image equivalent of Middle.
	
	UILower:		UI.Image equivalent of Lower.
	
	ShadedBottom:	Shaded (surface shader) equivalent of Bottom.
	
	ShadedMiddle:	Shaded (surface shader) equivalent of Middle.
	
	ShadedLower:	Shaded (surface shader) equivalent of Lower.
	

	-TO CREATE YOUR OWN BAR PREFAB-
	
	Custom Bar prefabs are straightforward to make. Your prefab must:
		1) Have the actual bar as the child, with it having position offset of your choosing.
		   This is to allow scaling with offsets.
		   
		2) The child must have a Component that inherits from Renderer.
		   (i.e. MeshRenderer, SpriteRenderer)
		   
		3) The renderer must use lightweightGradientLerp, lightweightGradientLerpSprite or surfaceGradientLerp.
		
			3a) Alternatively, if you wish to use your own shader, it must contain the values:
				Color _Color1, Color _Color2, Float _Val
